System for distributed, fully anonymous communications

This note describes a design for using the IOTA Tangle database as a foundation for facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between two parties. Encryption would be done with PGP key pairs. The Tangle would acts as both a public key registry as well as the message transfer mechanism.

Roberta and Sam each create a transaction that publishes their respective public key to an address that they control. The transaction hash can then act as the unique ID for their public key. This is similar conceptually to a PGP key registry service.

Roberta tells the world that her public key is available at her address.

Sam wants to communicate with Roberta.

Sam retrieves Roberta's public key from the address and creates a new transaction to Roberta's address with a message encrypted using her public key. The message contains the address of Sam's public key. Assuming this address is different than the address that Sam used to create the transaction, then there is no public connection between their two public keys.

Roberta retrieves the message and create
